# OnKey-Up
examples for on key up / keypresses eventlistners etc

i have a form and i have an input for a first name in this form.
This form has a submit BTN.


The Btn is currently disabled, i want it enabled if the input value in first name is more than 5 chars. Is it less then 5 char it should then become disabled again. Use onKeyUp event to solve the issue
